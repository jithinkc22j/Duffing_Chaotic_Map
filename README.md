This map is also known as the Holmes map.

Duffing map is a discrete time dynamical system which shows chaotic behaviour. Duffing equation which named after George Duffing is used to design damped oscillators. It is defined as follows.

                               x_n+1 = y_n 
                               y_n+1 = −b*x_n + a*y_n − y_n^3 
Here the map depends on two constants a and b. And the system produces chaotic behaviour on the values a = =2.75 and b = =0.2.
          
          Functions:
            Main function     : main.m
            Duffing function  :dufffing.m
      
      
      
      Input the value to x and y;

                x=  ; % Initial values
                y=  ; % Initial values
                a=  ; % Parameter value
                b=  ; % Parameter value
